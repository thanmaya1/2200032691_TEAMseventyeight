README
This is a sample website for a fictional company called ASUS Automobiles. The website includes pages for the company's profile, models, service, support, and sign in.

The website is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The layout is simple and easy to navigate. The website uses a parallax scrolling effect on some pages to create a visually engaging experience. The website also includes a navigation bar at the top of the page with links to each page.

The website is responsive, with a meta tag in the head section to ensure proper rendering on different devices.

The images and videos used in the website are not included in this repository, so you'll need to place your own images and videos in the corresponding folders.

There is a CSS file named "index.css" which contain the styling for the website.

Finally, the website is not intended to be used as a production-ready website, but rather as a starting point for a more complex website development project.

Additional Notes
It is important to note that the external links used in the example are not functional.
The images used in the example are not included, you will need to replace them with your own images.
The company "ASUS" used here is just a fictional company, it doesn't have any real-world connection with the company "ASUS".
